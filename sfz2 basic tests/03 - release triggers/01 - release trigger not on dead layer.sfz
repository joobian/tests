/// Test group: release trigger
/// Test purpose: release trigger not playing on a dead sustain layer
///
/// Test description:
/// A typical limitation of Gigastudio when playing release triggers is that
/// it will play the release triggers no matter if the sustain sample ended or
/// not. For some sets, this means that if you hold the note long enough, the
/// sample ends resulting in silence. If you then release the key, the release
/// triggered layer plays, which is unwanted.
///
/// sfz allows to prevent the release triggered sample playing if the sustain
/// layer died.
///
/// Play any note and release it immediately. Verify the release-triggered region
/// plays (110.ogg).
/// Play any note long enough so it ends. Then release it, verify the release 
/// triggered region not playing.
